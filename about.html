			<h1>Common Art Styles</h1>
				<p>The following are some common art styles that we like to get our art students familiar with.</p>
					<dl>
						<dt>ABSTRACT STYLE</dt>
							<dd>Art that illustrates anything, but not in the truest of forms, can be classified as abstract art. Every object on the canvas is represented as either colors and or shapes. A simple shape on the painting can do many wonders. The artist might augment the shape with some simple exaggerations. Sometimes, the shape is scaled down to produce the effect the artist wants on the canvas.</dd>
								
						<dt>EXPRESSIONISM</dt>
							<dd>The abstract style of art takes many forms. Expressionism is one such form. This style of painting is closely related to the emotions and feelings of human heart. This emotional overflow of human heart is illustrated from a subjectâ€™s perspective.</dd>
							
						<dt>POP ART</dt>
							<dd>Pop art is an art movement that emerged in the United Kingdom and the United States during the mid- to late-1950s.The movement presented a challenge to traditions of fine art by including imagery from popular and mass culture, such as advertising, comic books and mundane mass-produced objects.</dd>
